Notes for sample_stats2
=======================

Created sample_stats2.c from my prior changes to the original sample_stats.c; Decided to fork the program to maintain the integrity of the original.

sample_stats2 works identically to the original sample_stats in it's default invocation.

sample_stats2 differs from the original sample_stats in that:
  - it does not accept an initial integer argument N to count segregating sites in the first N sequences
